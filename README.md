# assignments-java
these are assignments that i have worked on in my foundation year

Here's a revised version of the README file, eliminating redundancies and organizing the information more clearly:

---

## **Skills Demonstrated**

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Implemented OOP principles including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in classes like `Advance`, `Ticket`, `SavingsAccount`, and `Person`.
- Demonstrated abstract classes (`Ticket`) and their concrete implementations (`Walkup`, `Advance`, and `StudentAdvance`).
- Overridden methods like `toString` for custom object behavior.
- Used constructor overloading to support multiple initialization options.

### **Data Structures and Algorithms**
- Utilized `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage and manipulation in programs like `MyContacts` and `MountainTrek`.
- Processed 2D arrays for complex data handling in `studentTest` and `multiDiminsional`.
- Implemented algorithms for sorting (`selectionSort`) and searching (`linSearch`).
- Designed efficient salary adjustments, data aggregation, and pattern recognition algorithms.

### **Mathematical and Statistical Computations**
- Solved real-world problems like unit conversion, polynomial evaluation, and Pythagorean triples.
- Computed statistical metrics such as sum, average, min, and max in `Wrapper`.
- Developed financial computations for deposit and withdrawal (`SavingsAccount`) and ticket price calculations (`StudentAdvance` and `Ticket` subclasses).
- Performed advanced geometric calculations for area, perimeter, surface area, and volume in `assignment3`.

### **String Processing**
- Built string manipulation methods to:
  - Replace characters and capitalize text (`StringSet1`).
  - Extract, swap, and reverse words (`StringSet2`).
  - Validate alphabetic content and analyze substrings (e.g., `challenge` and `DNA`).

### **Recursion and Advanced Algorithms**
- Designed recursive algorithms for summation, digit counting, and string reversal in `recursion` and `Recursion2`.
- Implemented logic-based methods like substring matching in DNA sequences (`nToN`) and dice pattern recognition (`DiceTest`).

### **User Interaction and Console Programs**
- Used `Scanner` to handle dynamic user inputs across programs like `menuCalc` and `menuMath`.
- Built menu-driven applications for arithmetic and mathematical functions.
- Designed formatted console outputs with escape sequences and ASCII art in `assignment1`.

### **Error Handling and Validation**
- Managed runtime errors with `try-catch` blocks in `Errors`.
- Implemented input validation to ensure robust program behavior.

### **Randomization**
- Incorporated `Math.random()` for random number generation in dice rolls, DNA sequences, and array operations.
- Used randomization in logic such as `randBet` and simulation-based methods.

### **Sorting and Efficiency**
- Implemented sorting algorithms (`selectionSort`) for numerical and string data.
- Measured and analyzed algorithm performance using a custom `StopWatch` class.

### **Statistical Analysis**
- Calculated averages, identified below-average values, and ranked top performers in arrays.
- Analyzed and processed sales data for trends and insights in `multiDiminsional`.

### **Geometry and Simulation**
- Simulated dice rolls and identified patterns like lucky nines and snake eyes (`DiceTest`).
- Calculated geometric properties dynamically based on user inputs in `assignment3`.

This version consolidates overlapping points and groups similar skills together for better readability and clarity. It provides a comprehensive overview without repeating the same ideas under different sections. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
